## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the Web Forum Project, a Rails-based application designed to provide a user-friendly platform for engaging discussions. This forum allows users to sign up, create posts, comment on discussions, and much more.

## Features

User Authentication: Secure sign-in functionality with Devise for enhanced security.

CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete posts and comments, using intuitive interfaces for seamless navigation and content management.

## Technology Stack

Backend: Ruby on Rails

Frontend: React with Typescript

Database: SQLite3

Authentication: Devise

## Moving Forward

I will be moving my project to two separate repositories, one for the frontend, and the other for the backend.

The current code in this repository was written to give me an idea of how I want to work with rails, and what are the basic functionalities I want to implement.
